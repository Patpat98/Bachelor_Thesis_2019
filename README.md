# Swarm of Waterbombing UAVs

Repository in scope of the Bachelor's Thesis group project. The code was used for developing a novel UAV design as well as developed simulation capable of showing that multiple smaller suppresant dropos in a swarming pattern are considerably more effective than large uncoordinated retardant drops. 

The simulation is documented in the operations subfolder whilst the others account for different stages and components of the UAV design. 

The simple mathematical model used for the fire simulation takes into account vegetation density as well as spreading speed emphasised by the random introduction of potential wind gusts.
