# Swarm of Waterbombing UAVs

Repository in scope of the Bachelor's Thesis group project aimed at designing a novel swarming UAV watermbombing platform aimed at more effectively suppressing wildfires. The code was used for developing the UAV design as well as a simulation capable of showing that multiple smaller suppresant drops in a swarming pattern are considerably more effective than large uncoordinated retardant drops at tackling large scale wildfires. 

The simulation is documented in the operations subfolder whilst the others account for different stages and components of the UAV design. 

The simple mathematical model used for the fire simulation takes into account vegetation density as well as spreading speed emphasised by the random introduction of potential wind gusts.
